# Luxart Vehicle Control v3
Over the past months, I have been slowing integrating additonal features into Faction's release (v2.0) of Lt. Caine's Luxart Vehicle Control resource, I would now like to release these to the public. 
Luxart Vehicle Control v3 adds:
* Lockout: Ability to lock all siren/light controls to prevent activation while typing (or eating).
* LuxHUD: A small visual representation of the scripts functionality modeled after real siren controllers. 
* Hazards Delay: Customizable "Hold-to-activate/deactivate" to prevent accidental activation when navigating trainers/vMenu.
* Hazards SoundFX: Added activation/deactivation sound effect of toggle switch. 
* Customizable User Settings & more.
